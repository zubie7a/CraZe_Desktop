## CraZe for Desktop

This is an application I started making while learning the basics of **AWT** and **Swing** graphics and GUI design in **Java** for the [Introduction to CS](https://github.com/zubie7a/Introduction_To_CS) and the [Programming Languages](https://github.com/zubie7a/Programming_Languages)' Class Projects.

This was made for educational purposes, and is licensed under the MIT License.

### How It Was Born
While I was learning about all those things about simple graphics and GUI design, I was thinking about the colorful drawings with **symmetry** and **geometry** that I've always enjoyed making by hand, and then I was very intrigued by the posibilities doing this **assisted by the computer**. 

It would become then very easy to draw lines and shapes while **dynamically** applying **transformations** using concepts of **trigonometry**, **geometry**, and **linear algebra**, and then having buttons, knobs, sliders, whatever, that could allow an user to modify the parameters that modifies colors, brushes, etc, and then draw to see the result of what would come out of such **mix of parameters**. 

Thus, **CraZe** was born in my spare time.

### Web Gallery 
These drawings were made by many people, some friends, some anonymous people over the web, and me.
