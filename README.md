#CraZe for Desktop

###Description
This is an application I started making while learning the basics of **AWT** and **Swing** graphics and GUI design in **Java** for the [Introduction to CS](https://github.com/Zubieta/Introduction_To_CS) and the [Programming Languages](https://github.com/Zubieta/Programming_Languages)' Class Projects. This was done for educational purposes, and is licensed for use under the **MIT License**.

Forgive my very *2012* coding style (When I was barely a 1-year-old programmer). Also, the code is ridiculously large because I had several repeated functions with minimal changes. I later refactored it for the [Android Version](https://github.com/Zubieta/CraZe_Android), at < 1/4th of its size! The [Web Version](https://github.com/Zubieta/CraZe_Web) has the same logic than the Android one, so there aren't many noticeable changes in code length or functionality distribution.

###How it was born
While learning all those things about graphics and GUI design, was very intrigued by the posibilities of drawing lines and shapes dynamically, and applying concepts of trigonometry, geometry, and linear algebra to these points and shapes in the graphics department, and in the GUI department, having buttons, knobs, sliders, whatever, that could allow an user to modify parameters that could be set as fixed or variable and see what would come out of such mix of user interactions (drawing in the app, and inputting control values). Thus, **CraZe** was born in my spare time.

###Web Gallery 
These drawings were made by many people, some friends, some anonymous people over the web, and me. Heck, some times during development, while testing a brush, something would go wrong, but the resulting bugged brush ended up looking nice and I decided to have it as a separate brush! Thats why bugs can become features sometimes hehe. Press the image to go to the gallery!
