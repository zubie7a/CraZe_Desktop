#CraZe

###Description
This is an application I started making while learning the basics of AWT and Swing graphics and GUI design in Java for the university classes. This was done for educational purposes, and is licensed for use under the MIT License. Forgive my very *2012* coding style (When I was barely a 1-year-old programmer). Also, the code is ridiculously large because I had several repeated functions with minimal changes. I later refactored it for the Android version, at < 1/4th of its size! The Web version has the same logic than the Android version, so there aren't many noticeable changes in length.

###How it was born
While learning all those things about graphics and GUI design, was very intrigued by the posibilities of drawing lines, shapes, and applying concepts of trigonometry, geometry, and linear algebra to these points and shapes in the graphics department, and in the GUI department, having buttons, knobs, sliders, whatever, that could allow an user to modify parameters that could be set as fixed or variable. Thus, CraZe was born in my spare time.

###Web Gallery 
These drawings were made by many people, but mostly me during development. Heck, some times while testing a brush, something would go wrong, but the resulting bugged brush ended up looking nice and implemented as a separate brush! Thats why bugs can become features sometimes hehe.
