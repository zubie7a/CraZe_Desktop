# CraZe for Desktop

### Description
This is an application I started making while learning the basics of **AWT** and **Swing** graphics and GUI design in **Java** for the [Introduction to CS](https://github.com/zubie7a/Introduction_To_CS) and the [Programming Languages](https://github.com/zubie7a/Programming_Languages)' Class Projects. This was done for educational purposes, and is licensed for use under the **MIT License**.

Forgive my very *2012* coding style (When I was barely a 1-year-old programmer). Also, the code is ridiculously large because I had several repeated functions with minimal changes. More modern versions have undergone extensive refactoring or even been made from scratch now that I've learned more things about "nice" coding!

### How it was born
While I was learning about all those things about simple graphics and GUI design, I was thinking about the psychedelic drawings with symmetry and geometry *(like tribal tattoos)* that I've always enjoyed making, and then I was very intrigued by the posibilities doing this assisted by the computer, drawing lines and shapes dynamically while applying concepts of trigonometry, geometry, and linear algebra, also applying transformations according to some values, and then having buttons, knobs, sliders, whatever, that could allow an user to modify the parameters that controlled such behaviors, and then see the graphical representation of what would come out of such mix of user interactions *(drawing in the app by hand, and having such drawings be altered by the inputted control values)*. Thus, **CraZe** was born in my spare time.

### Web Gallery 
These drawings were made by many people, some friends, some anonymous people over the web, and me. Some times during development, while testing a brush, something would go wrong, but the resulting bugged brush ended up looking nice and I decided to have it as a separate brush! Thats why bugs can become features sometimes! Press the image to go to the gallery!
